<h2> Introduction </h2>
  Detecting sentiment from a piece of text is a key part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is a foundational part of recommender systems which track a user’s affinities and aversions with the aim of matching the user with a product/ service that’s helpful for them.
  
  Most work on sentiment analysis has been done on short-form text data such as those derived from micro-blogging social media sites. Because of the succinct nature of these social media posts, it is perhaps easier to glean points of view than from longer pieces of text. 
  
  I would therefore like to perform sentiment parsing of long-form text in the form of book reviews. The aim is to see if different models are as capable in situations where the user leaves a more verbose review. Book cataloging websites might benefit from insights gained from this project in order to improve their recommendation system. If longer reviews do result in less reliable recommendations the website might decide to implement a word limit on reviews.
